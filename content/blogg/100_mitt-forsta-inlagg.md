In-store services
-----------------------------------
 As more and more customers are turning to online and mobile shopping, why we open a flagship store? It is more than just a store and it can make brand stronger, create an unforgettable experience for shoppers.

"Many brands see in-store services as a way to attract more customers through the door. Fashion retailers H&M, Gap and Uniqlo now offer repairs, personalisation and tailoring services in a bid to undo some of the environmental damage caused by fast fashion. Nordstrom’s flagship store in New York also offers shoe shining, a restaurant and bar.

However, leading the way in in-store services has to be London’s Liberty and Harrods, offering nail bars, hair salons, body piercing, florists and beauty spas to attract new customers and keep them onsite for longer.
Today, if flagship stores are going to act as effective marketing tools, they need to innovate, taking note of their digital competitors to offer exciting, engaging experiences. They need to act more like immersive theatres, creating a magical experience that tourists will go out of their way to visit."
