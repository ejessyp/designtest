=======================

This article is about color and typography analysis of 3 chosen websites. The aim is to analyze the websites styles and compare why they choose different color scheme and typography.

Urval
-----------------------
I chosed different areas of industry. They are: a high-end furniture store, a kid website and BTH(University) website. They have differnt styles because their audiences and products are different, such as ages, income and etc.

<li class="quest"><a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/">Nationalgeographic Kids</a></li>
<li class="quest"><a href="https://www.bth.se/">BTH</a></li>

I like to study nice furnitures design myself so it is not so hard to find this one. I also want to find a website relating to kids, then google kids and find this one with colorful design.

Metod
-----------------------

I am using <a href="https://www.colorzilla.com/">ColoZilla</a> to check the webpage colors and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm?hl=en">WhatFont</a> to find the fonts styles. I also read the source code of website to find information I want. I am using windows 10 OS with resolution 1366*768px.

Resultat
-----------------------
<h4>Philipp Selva</h4>

Philipp Selva is the total living luxury concept proposed by Selva with a line of elegant and refined furniture with a cosmopolitan feel. Just like their products, the website has showed the same elegance and sophisticated taste. It has used the same colortone from their products, for eg. the pictures showing on the homepage, the brandname and the navbar in gold color. Header and footers background color is #1D1D1B(the first one in the belowing color table) and the font color of navbar, brandname and menus is #927148(the third one in the belowing color table). Those two colors are the basic colors of the website. Font family openSans is used in body text and FuturaExtended is using for other footer column title, the names of the furnitures and the sidebar menus.

The following colors are used by the website. They have used dark color scheme but also soft and comfortable tone.
<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #1D1D1B">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #3C3C3C">

<h4>BTH</h4>
Blekinge Institute of Technology, BTH, has a distinctive focus on the digitalisation of society and sustainability. BTH’s task is to contribute to a more sustainable societal development through higher education, research and innovation.

The above is refereced from BTH website. Font for rubriker is Oswald Regular and body text is Freight Sans Pro Book Regular or Freight Sans Pro Book Semibold, belonging to sans-serif.

The website uses blue and light grey color scheme which is popular among IT and Telecom companies, such as Ericsson, Telenor and LinkedIn.  I should say it is minimalistic style, just match their goal sustainable.
<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #036">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #369">

<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #F5F5F5">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #fff">

</tr>

<h4>Nationalgeographic Kids</h4>
National Geographic kids is a mix of games, education, video and webshop. Their audiences are kids so the bright and saturated color scheme is used widely through the whole website. Colorful style is used to attract kids eyes and make them stay.Font geoBrandBlack (CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, "Gill Sans", "Gill Sans MT", sans-serif)  is used as rubriker and menus;  Font Microsoft YaHei is used for body text.

<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #F5812C">

</tr>
</table>

Analys
-----------------------
In general all three websites are very good designed both in color and layout. The Philipp Selva and NGkids use many pictures to show their products in the homepage while BTH uses less. Because of their audiences, they have used completely different color scheme and color tone as you can see from color palette. Philipp Selva use dark and calm color while NGkids use lots of saturated colors which are bright and coloful. BTH is using netural colors, cold and clean.
