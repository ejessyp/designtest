<h4>Philipp Selva</h4>

Philipp Selva is the total living luxury concept proposed by Selva with a line of elegant and refined furniture with a cosmopolitan feel. Just like their products, the website has showed the same elegance and sophisticated taste. It has used the same colortone from their products, for eg. the pictures showing on the homepage, the brandname and the navbar in gold color. Except the pictures, very few colors are used in the website. They put the social media icons in the left corner of the page and langauges selection in the right corner to show symmetry and balance. The general layout is header in the top, main(left sidebar, content) and footer. In the footer lines have been used to separate the footer columns. The navbar menu is hidden until one clicks, which is good to attract people's eyes on the flash images. Flash images(shift images after 4 seconds) have been showed in all the pages, like a banner, which is an emphasis to show the up to date products while it can generate problems of slow loading time.

<h4>BTH</h4>

Blekinge Institute of Technology, BTH, has a distinctive focus on the digitalisation of society and sustainability. BTH’s task is to contribute to a more sustainable societal development through higher education, research and innovation. So the website has minimalistic style to emphsize sustainability. The general layout is header(navbar menu), main(flash image on top, content bottom) and quite a big footer(3 footer columns and BTH contact info). BTH logo in the left corner has the same height of the right corner(consists of search and navbar menu), which is a balance. In the under pages, the same size images are chosen to show the clean style but in the mean time a bit dull.

<h4>Nationalgeographic Kids</h4>
[FIGURE src=image/NGkids.png?w=900 caption="Homepage of Nationalgeographic Kids."]
National Geographic kids is a mix of games, education, video and webshop. Colorful style is used to attract kids eyes. In the navbar menu, small icons are used to create kind of unity. The submenu shows only when mouse is hovering the top menu which helps users to navigate. The hierarchy of the menu is designed very good because this website has a lot of underpages and so many contents. Background images has been merged with the contents which shows a randomness.

Analys
-----------------------
In general all three websites are designed quite good to match their audiences. General layout is header, main and footer. Nationalgeographic kids uses lots of images and colorful schema. BTH uses less images and a clean schema. Philippselva uses a dark schema and quite many images. All of them has a good balance of elements.
