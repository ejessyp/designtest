Designprinciper
=======================
The main design principles are balance, alignment, emphasis, proportion, movement, pattern and contrast.
Balans
-----------------------
The whole website has used framework to produce the layout for header, footer, main. And vertical grid and typography are applied so generally it has very good balans.

Harmoni     
-----------------------
A background image is applied in the body area and I used the color from the image to apply for header and footer.

Unity
-----------------------
I used the same font for the H1 and the navbar because I think they are alike in function:guiding people to the right content.

RÃ¶relse
-----------------------
The navbar link has an animation of 2d transition and transform.

Bilder
-----------------------
I used different flash images for some of the pages, such as blogg and test to show they are different.
