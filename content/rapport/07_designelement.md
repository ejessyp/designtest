Designelement
=======================

Quite many elements have been used in the old CSS, such as lines, color, pictures. Below is what I have updated for kmom06 design elements.

Gradients
-----------------------
Header and footer have a light gradient from top to bottom.

Transparens
-----------------------
Region main has a background color with 0.5 opacity so the background image can been seen through.

Djup
-----------------------
H1 has a text shadow and the sidebar left has a box shadow which makes it 3d effect.

Typografi
-----------------------
H1 to h5 has a special style of font and the navbar as well. So they can standout and capture the eyes of users.

Bilder
-----------------------
I useed one background image for the body so I also borrowed color from the image to use in the header and footer.
